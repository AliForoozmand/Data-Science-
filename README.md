# Data-Science-

This course was conducted by Dr. Sebastian Grandis at the University of Innsbruck.
This course will start by introducing students to the programming language Python, reviewing in a mix of theory and hands on coding how to solve linear equation systems, perform Fourier analyses and numerical integration, and employ Monte Carlo algorithms. We will then discuss in the same format Bayesian inference and explore the different tools used for it, covering likelihood maximisation, posterior sampling, Bayesian model comparison and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling.
